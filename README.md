## SysEngg_SmartLock_Iolink
 This package consists of software and hardware developed to demonstrate the functionality of smartlock system using Io-Link communication protocol. It consists of project requirement documentation which delineates the user-specific requirements, use cases, and block definitions, more information about the used hardware can be referred from project documentation. 
 
## Project description
• A system demonstrates the function smart lock with specific communivation protocol Io-Link and a human machine inteface (HMI) developed using Node-Js to indicate real-time
status and failure responses

• Used Io-Link communication protocol (IEC 61131-9 I/O link) standards to send and receive data between the sensors, actuators and the embedded controller (ESP-32) using a Io-Link shield.

• System was developed using a systematic approach - System Engineering, firstly project scope was finalized with requirement documentation and subdivided into functional and non-functional requirements, followed by detailed architecture using use cases diagram and block diagram. The software stack was realized with a systematic sequence diagram and state machine diagram.
